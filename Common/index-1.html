<h1 id="comments-conventions">Comments Conventions</h1>
<p>The rule about comments is to not use them and instead make your code self-documenting.</p>
<p>Instead of writing a comment, create a new function or file.</p>
<p>Create a class only when there is a point to make an object, 
if there is no point to make an object and it will make the code harder to read,
prefer to create new files and functions.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Instead of writing:</p>
<p>```php
//Here we are going to send the message to the user
...</p>
<p>//Process the response that the user send to us
...
```</p>
<p>Write your code like this:</p>
<p>```php
function send_message_to_the_user($message_to_send)
{
    ...
}
...
send_message_to_the_user($we_have_new_product_message);</p>
<p>function process_user_response($response_to_process)
{
    ...
}
...
$what_user_send_to_us_response = get_what_the_user_send_to_us();
process_user_response($what_user_send_to_us_response);
```</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-comments">When to use comments</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use comments only inside functions when the algorithms are hard to explain via functions and variable names.</li>
<li>There is a high chance that you can explain an algorithm with better variable and function names so just DON'T use comments anywhere in the code. Write good and descriptive variable, function and file names instead.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-to-not-use-comments">When to NOT use comments</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don't use comments above functions</li>
<li>Don't use comments outside of functions</li>
<li>Don't use comments to explain what a variable means. Use better variable name.</li>
<li>Don't use comments to explain what a function means. Use better function name.</li>
<li>Don't use comments in the code. Make the code self-documenting. Write better variable, function and file names.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how also all variable names in all scopes have different names. This is important.</p>
<p>Every variable and function name in the entire project should be unique. 
This makes the code easier to understand and you are not going to make bugs by using a wrong variable or function somewhere.
Bugs like this are really hard to track and fix.</p>
